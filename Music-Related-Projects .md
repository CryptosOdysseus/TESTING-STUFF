Magenta

https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta --- 
Magenta is a research project exploring the role of machine learning in the process of creating art and music. 
Primarily this involves developing new deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms for generating songs, images, drawings, and other materials. 
But it's also an exploration in building smart tools and interfaces that allow artists and musicians to extend (not replace!) their processes using these models. 
Magenta was started by some researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team, but many others have contributed significantly to the project. 
We use TensorFlow and release our models and tools in open source on this GitHub. 
If youâ€™d like to learn more about Magenta, check out our blog, where we post technical details. 
You can also join our discussion group.

This is the home for our Python TensorFlow library. To use our models in the browser with TensorFlow.js, head to the Magenta.js repository.


ScribbleTune

https://github.com/scribbletune/scribbletune Create music with JavaScript https://scribbletune.com/--- SCRIBBLETUNE
Build Status
Use simple JavaScript Strings and Arrays to generate rhythms and musical patterns. 
Directly use the names of scales or chords in your code to get arrays which you can mash up using Array methods in ways you hadn't imagined before! 
Create clips of musical ideas and export MIDI files which you can import in Ableton Live, Reason, Garage Band or any music creation software that accepts MIDI files. 
You can even use Scribbletune in the browser with Tone.js!
